# Student-Performance-Prediction-
# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction

This project uses **Machine Learning** to predict whether a student will **Pass or Fail** based on factors like attendance, previous grades, and study habits.

## 📂 About the Project

This model is built using a dataset in **CSV format** containing various student details. The goal is to identify students who might be at risk of failing so that timely support can be provided.

### 🔍 Features Used
- Attendance
- Study Habits
- Previous Scores
- Parental Support

## 📌 Objective

To develop a **classification model** that predicts student performance (Pass/Fail), helping teachers and mentors take early action.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn & Matplotlib (for visualization)

## 📊 Model Details

- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Train-Test Split**: 80% - 20%
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Accuracy: 92.90%
  - Precision: 93.36%
  - Recall: 91.74%

## 📁 Dataset

Make sure to upload the dataset file:  
**`8. Student Performance Prediction.csv`**

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Load and clean the dataset.
2. Convert GPA to binary (1 = Pass, 0 = Fail).
3. Drop unnecessary columns.
4. Train a Random Forest Classifier.
5. Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix.

## 📷 Output Example

- Accuracy: ✅ 92.90%
- Precision: 🎯 93.36%
- Recall: 🔁 91.74%
- Confusion Matrix: Displayed using heatmap

## 📌 Note

This is a basic classification project for educational purposes and can be further improved using more advanced models or deeper feature analysis.
